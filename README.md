 ## Introduction
- In current years due to rapid growth and development of integration system of manufacturing if ICs from small scale integration (which allow the manufacturing of ICs with 1-10 transistor in a single chip) to ultra large scale integration (which allow manufacturing of ICs which consists of billions of transistor in a single chip) which lead the development in the electronics.

- Due to advancement of electronic world development takes place in the electronics devices in smart phones, laptops, computers which demand low power consumption, high speed performance with very less time propagation delay.

- In those devices arithmetic logic units adders plays a vital role to perform the various logical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in a system. Full Adder is the adder which adds three inputs and produces two outputs.

- In conventional full adder circuits, we use CMOS technology i.e. PMOS and NMOS are used as a switch in complementary mode. Such applications of NMOS and PMOS as a switch is called pass transistor logic. In Transmission Gates, both NMOS and PMOS transistors are combined in parallel fashion.

- When performance of both the circuits was compared, transmission gate circuit consumed less power as compared to the pass transistor circuit designed using CMOS logic.
